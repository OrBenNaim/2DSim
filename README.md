# Game of Life Simulation

## Description
This project simulates Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The simulation follows the game rules where cells on a grid evolve based on their neighbors. The project uses Python with pygame for visualization.

## Features
- **Grid Visualization**: Displays a grid of cells that can be toggled between alive and dead.
- **Simulation Control**: Start, stop, and pause the simulation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OrBenNaim/2DSim.git
    cd 2DSim
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
        pip install pygame numpy
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the simulation:
    ```bash
        python main.py
    ```

2. **Controls**:
   - Space: Pause/Resume simulation.
   - Enter: Start the simulation.
