# Game of Life Simulation

## Description
- This project simulates Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The simulation follows the game rules where cells on a grid evolve based on their neighbors. The project uses Python with pygame for visualization.

**Details*:* 
- A branch called “Sprint-4,” extending the previous branch.
Implement an alerting mechanism that allows the system to trigger alerts based on predefined events.
The mechanism should be designed to make it easy to add new alerts in the future.
Implement the following alerts:
  1. Alert when no more of a certain entity is alive.
  2. Alert when a Predator eats an Herbivore.
  3. Alert when the number of plants exceeds 90% of the grid space.
  4. The alerts should be printed to the console or logged appropriately.

   
## Features
- **Grid Visualization**: Displays a grid of cells that can be toggled between alive and dead.
- **Simulation Control**: Start, stop, and pause the simulation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OrBenNaim/2DSim.git
    cd 2DSim
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
        pip install pygame numpy
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the simulation:
    ```bash
        python main.py
    ```

2. **Controls**:
   - Space: Pause/Resume simulation.
   - Enter: Start the simulation.
